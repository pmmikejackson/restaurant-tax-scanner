# Texas Restaurant Tax Scanner

‚ö†Ô∏è **SECURITY NOTICE**: This repository previously contained an exposed Google Maps API key. The key has been removed and should be revoked immediately. See the [Security Setup](#security-setup) section below for proper configuration.

A comprehensive web application for identifying all applicable taxes for restaurant POS configuration across all 254 Texas counties.

## üîí Security Setup

**IMPORTANT**: Before using this application, you must set up your own Google Maps API key securely.

### Step 1: Get a Google Maps API Key
1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the **Maps JavaScript API** and **Geocoding API**
4. Go to **APIs & Services** ‚Üí **Credentials**
5. Click **+ CREATE CREDENTIALS** ‚Üí **API key**

### Step 2: Secure Your API Key
**Immediately after creating the key:**
1. Click on the key to edit it
2. Add **Application restrictions**:
   - For websites: Add your domain(s) to HTTP referrers
   - For development: Add `localhost` and your local domains
3. Add **API restrictions**:
   - Select "Restrict key"
   - Choose only: "Maps JavaScript API" and "Geocoding API"
4. Save the restrictions

### Step 3: Configure the Application
1. Copy `config.example.js` to `config.js`
2. Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key
3. **Never commit `config.js` to version control** (it's already in `.gitignore`)

```bash
cp config.example.js config.js
# Edit config.js and add your API key
```

### Step 4: For Production Deployment
For production environments, consider:
- Using environment variables instead of client-side configuration
- Implementing a server-side proxy for API calls
- Using domain restrictions on your API key
- Monitoring API usage and setting quotas

## üöÄ Features

- **Complete Texas Coverage**: All 254 counties with thousands of cities
- **Autocomplete Search**: Type-ahead functionality for counties and cities
- **Location Detection**: GPS-based automatic location detection
- **Tax Calculation**: Real-time tax rate calculation and display
- **Export Options**: JSON and CSV export for POS integration
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works on all devices
- **Secure API Integration**: Proper API key management

## üìÅ File Structure

The application has been modularized into separate files for better maintainability:

```
restaurant-tax-scanner/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.html          # Main HTML structure and UI
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css         # All CSS styles and responsive design
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js          # Google Maps API integration and utilities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data.js            # County/city mappings and geographical data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.js             # Main application logic and functionality
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.example.js  # Example configuration file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.js          # Your actual configuration (create from example)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html         # Original monolithic file (backup)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore         # Prevents API keys from being committed
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # This documentation
```

## üåü Benefits of Modular Structure

### For Developers:
- **Separation of Concerns**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in separate files
- **Easier Maintenance**: Modify styles without touching logic
- **Better Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different files
- **Code Reusability**: CSS and JS can be reused in other projects
- **Debugging**: Easier to locate and fix issues
- **Version Control**: Better diff tracking for changes

### For Performance:
- **Caching**: Browsers can cache CSS/JS files separately
- **Parallel Loading**: Files can load simultaneously
- **Minification**: Each file type can be optimized independently

### For Scalability:
- **Modular Development**: Add new features without affecting existing code
- **Testing**: Unit test individual components
- **Documentation**: Each file has a clear purpose

## üöÄ Future Enhancements
